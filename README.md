## Description
This repository contains my code for the Unit 9 project in the Treehouse Techdegree curriculum. This project uses SQLite and the SQL ORM, Sequelize -- along JavaScript (Node.js and Express) -- to create a REST API that will provide a way to administer a school database containing information about users and courses. Users can interact with the database to create new courses, retrieve information on existing courses, and update or delete existing courses.

To make changes to the database, users will be required to log in so the API will also allow users to create a new account or retrieve information on an existing account.

**NOTE: This project serves as the back-end code for the final project (Unit 10) in the Treehouse Techdegree curriculum.**
